- Working with raw data and text files
- Cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming messy datasets
- Pulling real-time data from APIs
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- A final capstone project simulating a real-world data analyst task

## Project Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a course project or module:

- `Absenteeism Project`  
  Data cleaning and analysis on employee absenteeism trends
